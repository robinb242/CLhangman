Command Line Hangman game
### Overview
This game is a traditional hangman game made simpler by narrowing the word choices to car manufactures.


### Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Inquirer module
* Object Oriented Javascript
* Contructor Fucntions
* Promises / Asynchronous programming

### Like to have
* Prompt for starting a new game or not, though ctrl-c works to escape the game.

### Notes
* Since the program requires the inquire NPM, you'll have to run
npm install on the directory you clone this repository to.


### How it works

1.  First a car is picked rondomly from a predetermined array set in game.js

2. The user guesses the letters present in that word.

3. When the user guesses correctly, that letter shows.

4. The user has 10 chances to guess the whole word.

5. If you run out of guesses you loose. If you complete the word you win.
