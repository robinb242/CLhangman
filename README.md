Command Line Hangman game
### Overview
The his game is a traditional hangman game made simpler by narrowing the word choices to car
manufactures.


### Technologies Used
* Node.js
* Inquirer module
* Object Oriented Javascript
* Contructor Fucntions
* Promises / Asynchronous programming

### Challenges encountered
* How solve the problem using Object oriented programming?
* How handle user inputs from console using inquirer?

### Solutions found
* Designing letter and Word as objects using contructor functions and including the methods that operate on that data in the objects helped
solve the problem.
* Handling promises and using recursive function calls helped handle the user input.

### How it works

1.  First a car is picked rondomly from a predetermined array set in game.js

2. The user guesses the letters present in that word.

3. When the user guesses correctly, that letter shows.

4. The user has 10 chances to guess the whole word.

5. If you run out of guesses you loose. If you complete the word you win.
